    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">About Us</h2>
    <p>Servicor has always had community at its heart. Founded in 2000 by two friends, their aim was to build a
      community where people like them could find everything they needed to settle into a new city: a job, a
      place to live, and some furniture to fill their place. What they created was the first online
      classifieds platform in the UK – a space where people could come together to help each other out in
      small ways.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Today, Gumtree remains one of the UK’s largest online classifieds sites serving communities up and down
      the UK, helping people find what they need most, affordably and locally. Gumtree provides a platform for
      people to connect around a life stage, a need, a pastime, passion or interest, from new parents trading
      buggies and nursery equipment, to bike enthusiasts, fuelling their passion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So whether it’s a buyer for that “thing” you no longer need, a new car to get you from A-B, a job, sofa
      or new flat, Gumtree makes Good Finds happen.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Our vision & mission</h2>
    <p>At Gumtree, we help make Good Finds happen. From great deals that save you a few extra pounds, to finding
      a buyer who will enjoy something as much as you did.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It’s all our responsibility to make sure getting a Good Find is always simple, easy, and enjoyable, so we
      can build a culture where people share more and waste less. We’re committed to building a recommerce
      culture in the UK. We believe it’s good for business, for society and for the planet.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We help make Good Finds happen because we believe everything can find new purpose.</p>
